Introduction to github (nothing relevant )
This is Arindam Roy and am a huge coding enthusiast with a wide palette of ambitions of the computer science flavour. To make it happen i have chosen github as a platform that would assist me and impart me experience and knowhow of realtime projects. I hope i shall not be disappointed in this endevour. 
Thank you for your patience.
